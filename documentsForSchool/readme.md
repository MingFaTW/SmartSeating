# Basic Information
This directory demonstrates the basic functions of SmartSeating on the PARTY platform.
The project uses Node.js/React.js along with Konva.js.
The SchoolSystem platform is built using Twig (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and phpMyAdmin to manage exams.

To avoid potential environment issues caused by installing too many packages, we opted to implement the core functions using plain JavaScript.
Due to system differences, PARTY utilizes pure JavaScript with Konva.js (via CDN) for building SmartSeating, instead of React.js.

This project will be my side project. :)
